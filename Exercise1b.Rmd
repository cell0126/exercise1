## Sampling from the normal distribution

First we sample 100 points from a lognormal distribution with $\mu=1$ and $\sigma=0.25$.

```{r}
x<-rlnorm(100,1,0.25)
```

## Histograms
Now we plot two histograms of our samples. The first one is in linear scale and the second one in logarithmic scale.

```{r}
h<-hist(x,breaks=100)
z<-log(x)
h2<-hist(z,breaks=100)
```

The mean of the samples is `r mean(x)
`
and the variance of the samples is `r var(x)`.
